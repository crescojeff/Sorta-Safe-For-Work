A digital photo-frame for your Mac OS X app icon dock 

# Motivation
Why would anyone want this?  Why not just have a normal-sized image viewer play a slideshow for you?  Workplace oppression is why -- many modern offices have done away with employee privacy entirely, reasoning that if said employees are doing actual work then they shouldn't need privacy.  This fries the fuck right out of the nerves of folk with social anxiety, but that's another problem, and one I haven't figured out how to solve with programming (yet).  Anyway, occasional R&R breaks throughout the day are important in my opinion and most relaxing activities/content would be considered 'not appropriate' for the workplace to varying degrees.  This project attempts to solve a very specific subset of that problem by providing a little app whose only function is to change its app icon according to the commands you give in the control window; this effectively gives you a digital photo frame in your OS X app icon dock, which you can see but the casual voyeur-looking-over-your-shoulder won't.  Not perfect, but pretty great for (c'mon, you knew where this was going) softcore erotica at work!  I wouldn't risk anything hardcore, just in case you have any eagle-eyed voyeurs at the office.  Looking at boobs lowers blood pressure, this is known, so point Sorta Safe For Work at your favorite folder of hotties and get your break on sorta safely!
